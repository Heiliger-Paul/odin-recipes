#Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website built as part of a learning exercise.
Project Structure

    index.html: The main page of the website, containing links to various recipes.
    /recipes/: A directory containing individual recipe pages.

#Steps to Build

    Create the Main Page:
        Build index.html with basic HTML structure.
        Add an <h1> heading titled "Odin Recipes."

    Create Recipe Pages:
        Create a recipes directory.
        Add individual recipe pages (e.g., lasagna.html), each with:
            An <h1> heading with the recipe name.
            An image of the dish.
            Description, ingredients, and steps sections.

    Link Recipes:
        Link each recipe page from index.html.
        Organize links in an unordered list for better readability.

    Add More Recipes:
        Repeat the process for additional recipes.
        Ensure all recipes are linked from the main page.

#Publishing the Site

To make your project accessible on the web:

    Ensure your main HTML file is named index.html.
    Use GitHub Pages:
        Go to your repository's settings.
        Enable GitHub Pages by selecting the main branch.
        Your site will be available at your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name.

#Notes

    The focus is on meeting the project requirements, not on aesthetics. Your project doesn't need to look like a professional website.
